Below is a **clear, build-ready product outline** you can hand directly to Brody (or any dev team). It’s structured the way strong fintech, sales, and network-marketing platforms are actually built: **core data first, then visualization, then motivation, then growth**.

I’m intentionally separating **what the app must do**, **what data it must ingest**, and **how it should feel to use**—because great dashboards fail when those get mixed together.

---

## **Vision (1-sentence North Star)**

Create a **mobile-first, always-accurate command center** for every LO, agent, and recruiter at **Oaktree Funding**—showing production, income, growth opportunities, and exactly *what to do next* to earn more.

---

# **1\. Core Architecture (Non-Negotiables)**

### **1.1 Single Source of Truth**

The app **must not rely on manual math or delayed exports**.

**Authoritative data sources**

* Loan origination system (production \+ funded amounts)  
* RevShare engine (tiers, unlocks, caps)  
* User org tree (sponsor → downline)  
* GoHighLevel (contacts, funnels, campaigns)  
* Event system (webinars, calls, conferences)  
* Resource library (training, tools, Home Hub)

**Key rule**

If a number appears in the app, it must match payroll and statements.

---

### **1.2 Identity & Roles**

Each user has **one login** and a dynamic role:

* BDM (pre-license)  
* Licensed LO  
* Recruiting Agent  
* Hybrid (Agent \+ LO)  
* Leader (multi-tier org)

Permissions control:

* What numbers they see  
* How deep they can see in the org  
* What actions they can trigger

---

# **2\. Home Dashboard (The Money Page)**

This is the screen people open **daily**.

### **Above-the-fold (no scrolling)**

* **Month-to-Date Earnings**  
  * Personal production income  
  * RevShare income  
  * Total projected (if pipeline closes)  
* **Progress Bar**  
  * Next tier unlock  
  * Next cap  
  * Next milestone reward

### **Below-the-fold**

* Pipeline snapshot (Submitted → Approved → Funded)  
* RevShare snapshot (Active tiers only)  
* Alerts:  
  * “You’re $1,240 from unlocking Tier 4”  
  * “3 people in your org are one deal away from activating”

---

# **3\. Production Tracking (Real-Time, Visual)**

### **3.1 Personal Production**

* Deals this month / YTD  
* Loan volume  
* Avg loan size  
* Income earned vs projected  
* BDM vs LO breakdown (per program rules)  
   Oaktree Funding Breakdown

### **3.2 Org Production**

* Total org volume  
* Active producers count  
* Inactive accounts flagged  
* Production heat map by state / city

Filters:

* Time (month, quarter, YTD, lifetime)  
* Role (BDM / LO / Agent)  
* Program type (purchase, refi, HELOC)

---

# **4\. RevShare Engine (This Is the Hook)**

### **4.1 Tier Visualization**

* Clean vertical stack:  
  * Tier 1 → Tier 7  
  * Locked vs unlocked  
  * Requirements shown visually  
* Earnings per tier (real dollars, not theory)  
* Cap progress per tier

### **4.2 “What Unlocks Next” Panel**

Explicit answers:

* “Recruit 2 more Tier-1 partners”  
* “Org needs 5 more funded loans this month”  
* “You’re 1 LO away from Tier 5 eligibility”

No guessing. No PDFs.

---

# **5\. Organization Visualization (Tree \+ Heat)**

### **5.1 Expandable Org Tree**

* Sponsor at top  
* Collapsible branches  
* Each node shows:  
  * Name  
  * Role  
  * Status (Active / Dormant)  
  * MTD production  
  * RevShare contribution

Tap any node → profile drill-down.

---

### **5.2 Heat Map View**

Color-coded by:

* Production volume  
* Recruit density  
* Dormant risk

Use cases:

* Leaders spotting weak branches  
* Corporate seeing geographic momentum

---

# **6\. Leaderboards & Gamification (Behavior Engine)**

### **6.1 Leaderboards (Toggleable)**

* Top producers (month / quarter)  
* Top recruiters  
* Fastest tier unlocks  
* Most improved (growth %)

Filters:

* Personal org only  
* Company-wide  
* Region-specific

---

### **6.2 Badges & Achievements**

Examples:

* First Funded Deal  
* First Recruit  
* Tier 3 Unlocked  
* $1M Volume Club  
* Consistency (3 months active)

Badges appear:

* On profile  
* In org tree  
* On leaderboard rows

---

# **7\. AI Layer (This Is Where It Becomes Elite)**

### **7.1 AI Coach (Context-Aware)**

The AI sees:

* Your production  
* Your org gaps  
* Your tier status  
* Your activity

It suggests:

* “Recruiting should be your focus this week”  
* “You’re production-heavy but org-light”  
* “Here’s who to call today to unlock Tier 4 faster”

---

### **7.2 Natural Language Queries**

Examples:

* “How much did my org make last quarter?”  
* “Who hasn’t closed in 60 days?”  
* “What happens if my Tier-2 closes 3 deals this month?”

---

# **8\. Growth Hub (Action, Not Just Data)**

### **8.1 Resources**

* Training modules  
* Webinar replays  
* Home Hub access  
* Marketing assets  
* Scripts & swipe files

### **8.2 Contextual Surfacing**

Resources change based on:

* Role  
* Tier  
* Behavior  
* Bottlenecks

Example:

If RevShare is flat → recruiting content floats to top.

---

# **9\. Community (Replace Facebook)**

### **Features**

* Announcements (company-wide \+ org-specific)  
* Wins feed (funded deals, new recruits)  
* Event calendar (fix the current issue)  
* Direct referral sending  
* Secure doc requests \+ e-sign

No distractions. No algorithm games.

---

Non-negotiable design rules:

* Thumb-friendly navigation  
* One-tap drill downs  
* No dense tables by default  
* Charts \> spreadsheets  
* Dark mode ready

If it doesn’t feel good on a phone, it fails.

---

### **Corporate Dashboard**

* Total company production  
* RevShare liability forecasting  
* Org growth velocity  
* Leader emergence  
* At-risk attrition signals

### **Controls**

* Tier rule updates  
* Badge creation

---

# **12\. Phased Build Plan (Recommended)**

* Basic RevShare totals

**Phase 2**

* Tier logic  
* Org tree

## **Final Note (For Brody)**

This is not “a dashboard.”

This is a **behavior-shaping platform**.

If users open it daily and feel clarity, momentum, and confidence—you win.
